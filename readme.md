# Data Science Portfolio
I have created this Repository containing my portfolio on my data science projects for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 

#### Project details are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data I have used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only.Data can be accessed under data directory._

## Contents:

- ### Deep Learning

	_Tools: scikit-learn, tensorflow, , keras, , Matplotlib
	
	 - [ Digit recognition using Google Collab (MNIST dataset)](https://github.com/r-pant/r-pant.github.io/blob/master/mnist.ipynb): - Google Collab is an awsome platform for building models and to use google tools. I tried to create a digit recognition model using Google TPU.

- ### Machine Learning

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas,  Matplotlib, Seaborn_ 

- ### Natural Language Processing

	_Tools: NLTK, scikit_learn, Tweepy
	
	 - [ Twitter text analysis (twitter dataset)](https://github.com/r-pant/r-pant.github.io/blob/master/twittr_sntimnt.ipynb): - Extracting data live and than working on to clean and then visualize in plot and as a WordCloud.. 
	    [Python code using tweepy library to extract twitter codes](https://github.com/r-pant/r-pant.github.io/blob/master/twitter_data.py) : - Use this python code and replcae the values to fetch data from twitter.
