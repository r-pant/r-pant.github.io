# Data Science Portfolio
I have created this Repository containing my portfolio on my data science projects for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 

#### Project details are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data I have used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only.Data can be accessed under data directory._

## Contents:

- ### Articles:

	- [Understanding Precision and Recall](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/12/accuracy-and-its-shortcomings-precision-recall-to-the-rescue/): - A blog to help you understand the need of metrices other than accuracy while evaluating any classification model.

	- [Optimizing EDA using Functions in Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/optimizing-exploratory-data-analysis-using-functions-in-python/): - A collection
